seccomp-nurse

* About

  =seccomp-nurse= is a sandboxing framework based on =SECCOMP=.

* How to use it?

:  $ git clone git://github.com/nbareil/seccomp-nurse.git
:  $ cd seccomp-nurse/
:  $ make
:  $ ./sanbdox -- /usr/bin/pdftotext ~/resume.pdf /tmp/resume.txt

  Easy, isn't it?

* Current limitations

  - =dlopen()= not supported *yet*

  - =clone()= (so =fork()= and threads) will *never* be supported

  - =socket()= not supported (yet?)

  - =exec*()= will *never* be supported

  At the moment, there is no security check implemented. The sandbox
  is wide open! It will be the next step.
